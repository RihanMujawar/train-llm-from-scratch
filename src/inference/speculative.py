"""
Speculative decoding (Leviathan et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2023), written from scratch.

Generating with a big model is slow because every token needs a full forward pass, and the
passes cannot overlap: token t+1 depends on token t. Speculative decoding uses a small,
fast *draft* model to guess the next ``k`` tokens, then runs the big *target* model ONCE on
all of them. The target's probabilities decide how many guesses to keep:

    for each draft token x with draft probability q(x) and target probability p(x):
        keep x with probability min(1, p(x) / q(x))
    at the first rejection, sample a replacement from  max(0, p - q)  (renormalized)
    if all k are kept, sample one bonus token from the target's next distribution

This rule makes the output distribution *exactly* the target model's distribution, no
matter how bad the draft is. A good draft just means more tokens kept per target pass. With
greedy decoding the rule reduces to "keep a guess if it equals the target's argmax", so the
result is identical to plain greedy decoding with the target.

This version recomputes the prefix on every call (no KV cache) to keep the algorithm in
view; :attr:`SpeculativeStats.target_calls` counts the expensive passes.
