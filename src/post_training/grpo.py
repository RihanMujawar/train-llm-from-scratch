"""
GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) core -- the DeepSeekMath / DeepSeek-R1 RL algorithm,
plus the switches that turn it into the 2025 follow-ups.

GRPO drops PPO's value network. For each prompt it samples a GROUP of G completions,
scores them with a verifiable reward, and uses the group's own mean/std to compute a
relative advantage -- so the baseline is the group, not a learned critic. The update is a
clipped surrogate plus a per-token KL penalty to the reference policy.

The variants differ in a few precise places, each one a keyword here:

=================  ==========================================================================
variant            what changes (keyword)
=================  ==========================================================================
GRPO               ``adv_norm="std"``; loss averaged per answer, then over answers
                   (``loss_agg="seq-mean-token-mean"``, the paper's formula)
DAPO               all tokens of the batch averaged together (``loss_agg="token-mean"``), a
                   larger upper clip ``clip_high`` ("clip-higher", keeps exploration alive),
                   groups with no reward spread skipped (``filter_groups`` in the trainer),
                   usually ``kl_coef=0``
Dr. GRPO           no division by the group std (``adv_norm="none"``) and a constant length
                   normalizer (``loss_agg="seq-mean-token-sum-norm"``); both remove biases
                   toward long wrong answers and toward easy/hard prompts
GSPO               one importance ratio per answer, the length-normalized sequence likelihood
                   ratio (``ratio_level="sequence"``), clipped with a tiny range (~3e-4)
=================  ==========================================================================

The trainer default (``token-mean``, symmetric clip, std-normalized advantages) is exactly
what this repo has always run.
